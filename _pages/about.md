In this blog, I explain machine learning concepts using diagrams, animations, and intuition.  

**About Me**  
I am currently a first-year master's student at [CIMEC](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en) exploring topics across Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Natural Language Processing.

Prior to that, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com) where I built production-level NLP capabilities for a consumer research product from ground zero.

I initially began my career as a software engineer but transitioned to data science through rigorous [self-study](https://github.com/amitness/learning).
